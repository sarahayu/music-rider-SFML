# Music Rider

I tried to make a copy of the popular game Geometry Dash and remake its first level, Stereo Madness. Includes a level editor that can add custom music. Default level is named "default".

Controls are:
[Space] for jumping
[Esc] or unfocusing the window to pause
[E] to enter Editor mode
[G] to enter Game mode
[Q], [W], [E], and keys on first row to cycle through available blocks, obstacles, and tools
Right click in Editor mode to place temporary start point for testing purposes
